Hi! I am Ehsaan Ali, a passionate AI researcher and educator. I hold a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence from FAST NUCES Islamabad, where I graduated as a gold medalist with a CGPA of 3.7/4 in January 2024. My pronouns are he/him.

I served as a Lab Instructor at FAST NUCES, teaching courses like Artificial Intelligence, Data Structures, and Computing Fundamentals. I also worked as a Research Assistant at the AIM Lab, where I contributed to cutting-edge research in AI, including projects focused on deep learning, big data analytics, and multimedia forensics.

My research interests span Deep Learning, Image Processing, Big Data Analytics, and NLP, with a focus on building scalable AI frameworks and applying AI to real-world challenges. I am particularly drawn to ethical and innovative uses of AI, striving to develop solutions that prioritize fairness and inclusivity.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an avid advocate for education and love sharing knowledge with others. When I’m not working on AI, I enjoy exploring new programming tools, staying up-to-date with research trends, and mentoring students.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss AI research, teaching strategies, or collaborative opportunities!
